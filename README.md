# Task 8: K-Means Clustering – Breast Cancer Dataset

Hi!! This repository contains my implementation of clustering using the K-Means algorithm, applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  
The goal was to perform unsupervised learning to group data points into clusters and evaluate clustering quality.

---

## What This Task Covers

- Import and preprocess the dataset  
- Encode categorical variables  
- Handle missing values and ensure all data is numeric  
- Normalize features using `StandardScaler`  
- Apply the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters (K)  
- Fit K-Means and assign cluster labels  
- Evaluate clustering using:
  - Inertia (within-cluster sum of squares)
  - Silhouette Score
- Visualize clusters in 2D space using PCA

---

## Key Learnings

- How K-Means clustering works and its limitations  
- The role of feature scaling in clustering performance  
- Using the Elbow Method to estimate the best K value  
- Evaluating clusters with Silhouette Score  
- Reducing dimensions with PCA for visualization

---

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler, LabelEncoder, silhouette_score, PCA)  
- Matplotlib for plotting
